# Simple Node Server

This is a very basic Node.js server that serves HTML and CSS files. 


## Installation

To use this server, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install any required dependencies.
4. Run the command `node index.js` to start the server.

The server should now be running and listening for requests on port 3000.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can also access specific HTML files by including the file name in the URL, such as `http://localhost:3000/about.html`.

## Contributing

This is a simple example server and contributions are not expected. However, if you do want to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
